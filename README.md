# Error Packet Detection Project

## Dataset Download and Setup

To run this project, you need to download the dataset manually due to its size and the Google Drive virus scan warning for large files.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Click on the following link to download the dataset: [Download Dataset](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1Q3JrNdCvlWM2MpvmVoTdeTeMUNipxC_e&export=download&authuser=0)
   - You might encounter a Google Drive warning about the file size. Please proceed by clicking "Download anyway".

2. **Place the Dataset:**
   - Once the download is complete, move the file to the following directory in your local project folder:
     ```
     errorpacketdetection/data/
     ```
   - Rename the file to `CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-1-1conn.log.labeled.csv` if it isn't already named correctly.

3. **Verify File Placement:**
   - Ensure the dataset file is located at:
     ```
     errorpacketdetection/data/CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-1-1conn.log.labeled.csv
     ```
   - This path is necessary for the scripts within this project to function correctly.
